Portfolio: business analytics (M.S.) and real estate (B.B.A.)—ML models, comps, forecasting, and reporting.
This repository contains projects from my M.S. in Applied Business Analytics and B.B.A. in Real Estate. It demonstrates skills in R, Excel, and applied data analysis, including data visualization, classification models, and real estate valuation.


## Files Overview

### Data files (/temp)
- **insurance.csv** — Maple Insurance dataset with demographic, policy, and claim variables; used for segmentation visualizations and the Shiny dashboard.  
- **TechSales_Reps.csv** — dataset of sales professionals; used for Net Promoter Score (NPS) prediction.  
- **MYOPIA.csv** — dataset from a myopia study; used for logistic regression and decision tree modeling.  
- **apple.csv** — used car / product dataset; used for regression and time series analysis exercises.  
- **real_estate_development_analysis.xlsx** — Excel workbook for real estate valuation and sensitivity analysis; open in Excel to explore Summary and Model sheets.  

### R scripts (/projects)
- **week_05_data_visualizations.R** — creates three ggplot2 charts showing relationships between education, retirement status, marital status, and claim amounts (Insurance dataset).  
- **app.R** — interactive Shiny app for exploring insurance customer segmentation with pie charts, bar plots, jitter, scatter, and income distributions.  
- **homework_05_machine_learning.R** — applies logistic regression, bagging, boosting, and random forest to predict whether a sales professional receives a high NPS score (TechSales dataset).  
- **hw_03_data_mining_and_warehousing.R** — applies logistic regression and tree-based models to predict myopia incidence from health variables (Myopia dataset).
