# Resume
Portfolio: business analytics (M.S.) and real estate (B.B.A.)—ML models, comps, forecasting, and reporting.
This repository contains projects from my **M.S. in Applied Business Analytics and B.B.A. in Real Estate**. It demonstrates skills in **R, Excel, and applied data analysis, including data visualization, classification models, and real estate valuation**.


## Files Overview

### Data files (/temp)
- **insurance.csv** — Insurance dataset with demographic, policy, and claim variables; used for segmentation visualizations and the Shiny dashboard.  
- **TechSales_Reps.csv** — dataset of sales professionals; used for Net Promoter Score (NPS) prediction.  
- **MYOPIA.csv** — dataset from a myopia study; used for logistic regression and decision tree modeling.
- **maple.csv** - dataset from a maple study, used for logistics regressions
- **apple.csv** — used car / product dataset; used for regression and time series analysis exercises.

### Data File for Real Estate Development and Analysis
- **real_estate_development_analysis.xlsx** — Excel workbook for real estate valuation and sensitivity analysis; open in Excel to explore Summary and Model sheets.  

### R scripts (/projects)
- **week_05_data_visualizations.R** — creates three ggplot2 charts showing relationships between education, retirement status, marital status, and claim amounts (Insurance dataset).  
- **Week_7_exercise_app.R** — interactive Shiny app for exploring insurance customer segmentation with pie charts, bar plots, jitter, scatter, and income distributions.
- **homework_02_machine_learning.R**-applies basic regression/classification methods as part of early machine learning coursework.  
- **homework_03_machine_learning.R**-expands on ML concepts with evaluation metrics and model comparisons.  
- **homework_05_machine_learning.R** — applies logistic regression, bagging, boosting, and random forest to predict whether a sales professional receives a high NPS score (TechSales dataset).  
- **hw_03_data_mining_and_warehousing.R** — applies logistic regression and tree-based models to predict myopia and maple incidence from health variables (Myopia and Maple dataset).
- **hw_04_data_mining_and_warehousing.R**- logistic regression, LDA, and QDA models on the ISLR2 Weekly dataset (train ≤2008 / test >2008), plus a toy LDA example.
- **hw_06_data_mining_and_warehousing.R**-implements advanced data mining or warehousing techniques such as clustering or multivariate analysis. 
- **business_analytics_hw_02.R** -covering foundational business analytics (descriptive statistics and regression). 
- **business_analytics_hw_03.R**-focusing on intermediate analytics such as multiple regression or time-series modeling.  
- **business_analytics_hw_04.R**- advanced business analytics project combining statistical modeling and visualization.
